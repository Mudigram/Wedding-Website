        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p class="story-text">The first time I noticed him, he was frowning at his book like he wanted to beat it. Engineering students and suffering‚Äî5 & 6.

            Every time I came to the library, he was there. Focused. Unbothered. So, one day, I decided to shake things up.
            
            "Oga Engineer, you no dey rest? Abi na crude oil you dey find inside book?"
            
            He looked up, smirked. "At least my own book get figures. Your own na only plenty grammar."
            
            That was it‚Äîbanter, shared snacks, and lingering glances. I liked how serious he was about everything. Maybe even me.
            
            Before I left one evening, I slipped a note into his book.
            
            That night, my phone pinged.
            
            "So, what‚Äôs the probability of me seeing you outside this library? Asking for an engineer."
            
            I grinned. He was good.
            
            "High probability, if you ask nicely. Asking for a writer."
            
            And just like that, we became something more.</p>
